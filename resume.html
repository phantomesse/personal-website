    <h3>Google Inc.</h3>
    <p>
      I've been a software engineer at Google for several years. Throughout
      these
      years, I've worked on various projects in Search Ads as well as on
      open-sourced Dart components. Projects that I've helped launch in Search
      Ads
      include the Google Ads UI rewrite, Recommendations, and Search Ads Account
      Health Score. I wrote and currently maintain the dialog, expansion panel,
      and spinner for Dart components. I also manage global communications and
      the
      New York chapter for the Asian Google Network employee resource group.
