<h3>Google Ads Bridge Cards</h3>

<p>
  I designed a deck of Google Ads-themed playing cards as a prize for a
  quarterly bug fixing event during Q1 2019. Each card has a custom front and
  back. The front of the cards have multiple Google Ads logos lightly overlayed
  behind the suit designs. The numbers on the cards are written in Google Sans
  and the colors are official Google Material colors. The back of the cards
  incorpate a pattern using Google Ads logo in varying opacities.

  The card decks were distrbuted to over 100 engineers across Google Ads teams
  in both the Mountain View and New York offices.
