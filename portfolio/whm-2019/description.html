<h3>Women's History Month 2019 Posters</h3>

<p>
  As part of a collaboration between Women@Google and the Asian Google Network,
  I designed four poseters to celebrate both Women's History Month and Asian
  American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Each poster features a different
  Asian American woman who has made a considerable scientific or cultural
  contribution.

  I designed these posters to look like the photos and words were cut out and
  pasted onto the poster. Each poster is designed to feature a Google brand
  color.

  These posters were printed and displayed globally across 20 Google offices as
  well as shared digitially with employee resource group aliases during both the
  month of March (Women's History Month) and May (Asian American Pacific
  Islander Heritage Month). During Women's History Month, a different poster was
  highlighted over email by a senior Asian woman leader at Google.
