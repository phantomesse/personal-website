<h3>Women's History Month 2018 Posters</h3>

<p>
  As part of a collaboration between Women@Google and the Asian Google Network,
  I designed four posters and a timeline to celebrate Asian American women and
  their achievements during Women's History Month. Each poster features a
  different prominent Asian American woman. The timeline highlights the large
  strides that Asian American Women have made throughout history.

  When I was designing these posters and timeline, the Google Material spec had
  just been announced. I designed the assets in accordance with the Google
  Material spec, which featured the Google Sans font and a light, bright
  background with ample room for white space. Each poster incorporates a
  different Google color, and I chose to make all the photos grayscale with a
  color tint in an effort to make different photos with different color palettes
  and resolutions fit together cohesively.

  These posters were printed and displayed globally across 15 Google offices as
  well as shared digitially with employee resource group aliases.
